## Linux usage

Install dependencies and start the local development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).

Set up local Notion credentials before syncing:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`. See [Environment setup](#environment-setup) for where to find both values.

Sync conference data from Notion:

```bash
npm run sync
```

Validate the site before committing or pushing synced changes:

```bash
npm run build
npm run check
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

If `astro` is not recognized, restore the local dependency install from the lockfile:

```bash
npm ci
```

## Windows usage

When using PowerShell on Windows, prefer `npm.cmd` for repo commands. PowerShell may block the `npm.ps1` shim with an execution-policy error.

Install dependencies and start the local development server:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 55000
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:55000](http://127.0.0.1:55000).

Set up local Notion credentials before syncing:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your `NOTION_API_KEY` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`. See [Environment setup](#environment-setup) for where to find both values.

Sync conference data from Notion:

```powershell
npm.cmd run sync
```

Validate the site before committing or pushing synced changes:

```powershell
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run check
```

Preview the production build locally:

```powershell
npm.cmd run preview
```

If `astro` is not recognized, restore the local dependency install from the lockfile:

```powershell
npm.cmd ci
```

If PowerShell reports that `npm.ps1` cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled, either keep using `npm.cmd` or allow local user scripts:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

If Astro fails with `listen EACCES` on `localhost`, `::1`, or low-numbered dev ports such as `4321`, use IPv4 localhost with a high port:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 55000
```

## Environment setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the placeholders before running `npm run sync` or `npm.cmd run sync`.

```env
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Notion API key

1. Open [Notion integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).
2. Create a new integration, or open the existing integration for this project.
3. Copy the **Internal integration secret**.
4. Paste it into `.env` as `NOTION_API_KEY`.

The key should start with `secret_`. Do not commit `.env`; keep real secrets local.

### Notion database URL / ID

1. Open the Notion database named **List of Specific Conferences**.
2. Copy the database URL from the browser address bar.
3. Find the 32-character database ID in the URL, then paste it into `.env` as `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`.

For example, this URL:

```text
https://www.notion.so/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx?v=...
```

uses this `.env` value:

```env
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Dashed IDs also work:

```env
NOTION_DATABASE_ID=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Sync from Notion

1. Create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and copy the API key.
2. **Connect the integration to the database** (required - without this, sync fails with `object_not_found`):
   - https://www.notion.so/my-integrations -> your integration (e.g. **eu-conf**) -> **Content access** -> **Edit access** -> add **List of Specific Conferences**
3. Use the **Internal integration secret** from that same integration as `NOTION_API_KEY` in `.env` (not a key from a different integration).
4. Set `NOTION_DATABASE_ID` from the database URL as described in [Environment setup](#environment-setup).
5. Run the sync command for your platform from the Linux or Windows usage section above. The sync script loads `.env` automatically.

This refreshes `data/conferences.json`, which the site reads at build time.

## Build & deploy

Run the build, check, and preview commands for your platform from the Linux or Windows usage section above.

GitHub Pages deployment is configured in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. Enable **Pages** in the repo settings (source: GitHub Actions).

If your repo name is not `eu_powersys_conferences`, update `base` in `astro.config.mjs` to match `/your-repo-name/`.

## Troubleshooting

### Git cannot write `.git` in this workspace

If Git commands fail with permission errors such as:

- `Unable to create '.../.git/index.lock': Permission denied`
- `cannot open '.git/FETCH_HEAD': Permission denied`

these usually indicate the workspace path has restricted write access to `.git`.

You can grant your current Windows user full control over `.git` from an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
$repo = "C:\<your-workspace>\eu_powersys_conferences"
takeown /f "$repo\.git" /r /d Y
icacls "$repo\.git" /grant "$($env:USERNAME):(OI)(CI)F" /T /C
```

If the commands still fail, keep using the automation-safe fallback (sync/build/check in a writable temp clone).

## Data model

Each conference includes:

| Field                           | Source (Notion)                                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title                           | `Name`                                                                      |
| Official website                | `Official website` (falls back to link in `Name` if empty)                  |
| Organization                    | `Org`                                                                       |
| Year                            | `Year`                                                                      |
| Location                        | `Location`                                                                  |
| Conference dates                | `Date`                                                                      |
| Abstract / full-paper deadlines | `abstract ddl`, `full paper submission ddl`                                 |
| Submission portal opens         | `submission opening` (optional; see [Submission status](#submission-status)) |
| Acceptance rate                 | `Acceptance Rate`                                                           |

### Submission status

Each conference card may show a submission badge. Status is computed from **today's date** and the deadline fields above.

The **submission cutoff** is the abstract deadline (`abstract ddl`) if set; otherwise the full-paper deadline (`full paper submission ddl`). A conference must have at least one of these to get any submission badge.

#### Accepting submissions

A conference is labelled **Accepting submissions** when **all** of the following are true:

1. It has a submission cutoff (abstract or full-paper deadline).
2. The cutoff is still in the future (submissions have not closed).
3. **Either** no `submission opening` date is set in Notion, **or** today is on or after that date (the portal is open or assumed open).

The badge reads: `Accepting submissions · Abstract due …` or `Accepting submissions · Full paper due …`.

#### Opening soon

A conference is labelled **Opening soon** when **all** of the following are true:

1. It has a submission cutoff (abstract or full-paper deadline).
2. The cutoff is still in the future (submissions have not closed).
3. A `submission opening` date **is** set in Notion.
4. Today is **strictly before** that opening date (the portal is not open yet).

The badge reads: `Submissions not open yet · Opens …`.

On the `submission opening` date itself, the label switches from **Opening soon** to **Accepting submissions**.

#### Other statuses

| Status | When |
| ------ | ---- |
| Submissions closed | A cutoff exists but is in the past |
| *(no badge)* | No abstract or full-paper deadline is set |

#### Filters and overview

- The overview stat and **Opening soon** filter count only conferences labelled **Opening soon**.
- The **Accepting submissions** stat and filter count only conferences labelled **Accepting submissions** (not Opening soon).
